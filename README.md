# Security Gateway for Automated Micro-Segmentation and VPN Encryption in Industrial Legacy Systems 

This repository contains the accompanying code and data for the **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** of the paper "Security Gateway for Automated Micro-Segmentation and VPN Encryption in Industrial Legacy Systems", on securely integrating legacy devices into industrial networks. The goal is to automate micro-segmentation and VPN encryption for legacy devices through security gateways, thereby ensuring a seamless migration towards a more secure infrastructure.
